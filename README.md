# The-Trading-Pitstop
The Trading Pitstop App

We use the Calculator to calculate our $Risk for each trade:
  By entering your currency pair and the Entry, SL and TP we can work out what lot size you should use to master Risk Management and make it easy for everyone
  
 ### Goals:
 * To be able to enter your trades details into the App and get the correct lot size you should use to only risk 1% of your account
 * Enter the trades that you took into the App and let the App store all your trades in a Database
